Three jupyter notebook are there; 
1. 'Sample CNN model to save'
    Sample CNN model to classify cats and dogs and save this model to given directory;
2. 'Predicting with ckpt'
    This is about restoring saved parameters to a defined graph; here we define graph manually ie. without .meta file
3. 'Continue training'
    Training will be continued with saved model from saved iteration number or global step.
